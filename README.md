 ## AI-Powered Medicine Recommendation System

This project is an AI-driven application that suggests appropriate medications, diets, precautions, and workouts based on user-reported symptoms. It uses machine learning models trained on symptom-disease datasets to make personalized health recommendations.

 ## Features

- Predicts the most likely disease based on input symptoms
- Recommends suitable medications, dietary plans, precautions, and exercises
- Utilizes symptom severity to prioritize recommendations
- Built using machine learning (SVM classifier)
- Interactive and modular Jupyter Notebook

- ##  Project Structure

- `MedicineRecommendationSystem.ipynb` – Main notebook implementing the AI pipeline
- `Training.csv` – Symptom-disease training dataset
- `Symptom-severity.csv` – Maps symptoms to severity levels
- `medications.csv`, `diets.csv`, `precautions_df.csv`, `workout_df.csv` – Recommendations datasets
- `description.csv`, `symtoms_df.csv` – Supporting metadata

- ##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

- ##  Use Case

This AI system can be adapted into virtual healthcare assistants, basic diagnostic tools, or self-care platforms to assist users in making informed medical decisions before seeking professional consultation.
